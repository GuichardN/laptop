		<h2 class="light">Custom FK8 Hype-R</h2>
        <p class="section-subhead">I still remember when these first arrived in Canada. Such a beautiful body design.</p>
        <p>This one here modified to perfection.</p>
        
        <p>This FK8 is the definition of a purpose-built weapon. The custom repaint alone sets it apart—1 of 1 work that instantly tells you this isn’t just another championship Type R. It’s a statement before the engine even turns over.</p>
        
        <p>The aero ties the whole build together. Not overdone, not trying too hard—just functional aggression. With the custom Morimoto headlights up front, the car has that sharp, modern look that OEM could never touch.</p>

        <p>The Mishimoto intercooler keeps things cool when the boost hits, and paired with the PRL titanium inlet it breathes effortlessly. It’s the setup you choose when you care about efficiency just as much as power—clean, consistent, and reliable.</p>

        <p>Ray’s wheels complete the look perfectly. Lightweight, strong, and iconic. When a build runs Rays, you already know the owner cares about performance first, looks second—even though these wheels hit both.</p>

        <p>The Acuity shifter transforms the driving experience. Every shift is tight, mechanical, and intentional. It’s one of those mods that reminds you why the Type R is a driver’s car before anything else.</p>

        <p>With a downpipe, full exhaust, and a dialed Hondata tune, this FK8 delivers exactly what enthusiasts want—responsive throttle, aggressive turbo noises, and power that hits consistently through the rev range.</p>
         </figure>
        <aside><P>What's a better a FWD hot hatch?</P>
        </aside>
        <p>Inside, the carbon touches elevate the entire cabin. Carbon steering wheel, carbon dash overlays, carbon seat backing—clean, purposeful upgrades that bring a true motorsport feel without overwhelming the interior.</p>
        
        <p>The EBC big brake kit is a serious upgrade. It’s one of those mods that shows this car wasn’t built for Instagram—it's built to be driven. Hard. Fast. And with total control.</p>

        <p>Every piece of this car has intention behind it. No random parts, no clashing styles—just a cohesive vision executed properly from top to bottom.</p>

        <p>Most FK8s look good with a few mods, but when you bring together 1 of 1 paint, functional aero, premium internals, and high-end supporting mods, the build becomes something different. Something personal. Something that stands out without even trying.</p>

        <p>The way this car was cared for from day one says everything about the owner. Straight from the dealer to custom paint, ceramic coating, and full underbody protection. No hesitation, no shortcuts. Just meticulous preservation to match a meticulous build.</p>

        <p>The owner has an incredible attention to detail—every bolt, every finish, every mod looks intentional. Nothing is rushed, nothing is out of place. It’s the kind of build where the more you look, the more you appreciate.</p>

        <p>Clean, aggressive, functional, and one of one. This FK8 isn’t just built—it’s curated.</p>

		<h2>F87 M2 &amp; Fitted</h2>
		<p>If you want to talk clean fitment and simplicity this is it. No crazy aero, no loud wrap—just proper height, proper spec wheels and everything sitting exactly where it should.</p>

        <p>Love it or hate it this design has to be one of the best BMW has for the M2. The proportions are so on point that even small changes make a huge difference in presence.</p>

        <p>It's crazy what a good wheel setup and a nice clean drop can do to a car. You don’t even need a wild build—just dialed stance and suddenly it looks like a completely different machine.</p>

        <p>Simplicity is what most builds lack. Everyone wants to throw every part at the car, but the clean ones with a clear vision always age the best.</p>

        <p>Downpipe, tune and this is plenty. You get that perfect balance of daily drivability and “this thing actually rips” when you put your foot down.</p>
        
        <p>High key fact: the N55 M2 sounds much better than the S55. Deeper tone, less raspy, and with the right exhaust it has that classic BMW character the new stuff is missing.</p>
            <aside style="background-color: white; color: black;">The real question is 7-Speed DCT or 6MT?</aside>

        <p>The F87 is one of the last BMWs that actually feels raw. No overdone tech, no fake sound pumping—just a small chassis with real feedback through the wheel and pedals.</p>

        <p>What makes the M2 so special is how personal it feels. Every small mod—exhaust, wheels, suspension—changes the whole personality of the car. It reacts instantly to whatever direction you take the build.</p>

        <p>This is the type of car where “less is more” actually works. One or two quality mods go further than ten random ones. You can tell right away when a build has intention behind it.</p>

        <p>When you see an M2 set up properly, you can’t miss it. The stance, the squat, the wide hips—it's just one of those cars that looks aggressive even standing still.</p>

        <p>And performance-wise, this platform punches way above its weight. A few simple mods and you’re already at a level that embarrasses cars way more expensive.</p>

        <p>You don’t need a full catalog of parts to make an M2 hit. Just taste, vision, and the right touches. That’s what separates clean builds from cluttered ones.</p>

		<h2>FROM THE START</h2>
		<p>This was my car and let me tell you how much I loved to drive and it and modify it. It was the car I used to learn how to work on others cars and bought my first camera to capture those moments.</p>
		<p>The first car I was able to purchase was a 2007 Hyundai Tiburon and I got it just because of it's looks. Thaht car then paved the way for where we arrived here. My inclination for creation and hands on work both took a front row seat with this build.</p>
		<p>I started from something as simple as wheels then it kept progressing to suspension, radio, intake all the way until this car had an upgraded turbo kit installed from Gencoupestore. </p>
		<p>I never knew this car was going to handle the power as well as it did and it put it down with no issues either. 413whp at the rear wheels mated to a 6-Speed transmission with a Torsen-limited slip diferrential made it effortless for the wheels to transfer power effectively.</p>

		<aside>
			<p>What you think I would let you ride off in a Hyundai?</p>
		</aside>

		
		<p>Parted ways with this car in September of 2025 but it still roams the streets of Ottawa but with a new owner.</p>
		<p>To list a few mods we have Scale Suspension coilovers custom rates at 18KG/MM Front 12KG/MM Rear respectively</p>
        <P>Car was taken to Guelph to be remote tuned by Alphaspeed one of the best tuners for the platform</P>
		<p>A little mishap on the first trip to guelph we had the improper hose in the fuel tank attached to our DW340 which ended uo swelling up and deteriorating. That ended up being a $500 tow back to Ottawa from 2.5hours from Guelph. <b><i>ouch</i></b></p>

		<p>Upgraded clutch and the works. This was my daily commuter 6 days a week for 5 years and never left me stranded, limitedslip made it a beast in the winter too fro being rwd</p>
		<p>I never imagined a car like this would be so fun to own and be the tarting path to my automotive passion.</p>

		<h2 class="dark">Honda vs Ford: Two Builds, No Mercy</h2>
		
		
		<p>This shot is pure chaos and precision in one frame. On the left you’ve got a one-of-one FK8 Type R, repainted cleaner than anything the factory has ever put out. It’s sharp, calculated, and carries that “don’t touch it unless you know what you’re doing” energy.</p>

        <p>Next to it? A Focus ST that looks like it was built in a wind tunnel with bad intentions. Massive wing, aggressive aero, overfenders that swallow the wheels, and a stance that screams “move or get moved.” Nothing about it is subtle — and that’s exactly the point.</p>

        <p>The contrast between the two builds goes crazy. One is surgical, detailed, and refined with premium paint and high-end components. The other is wild, wide, and ready to bully anything next to it. Two different approaches, same level of commitment.</p>
        <aside class="light">
			<p>Big wing or bigger wing?</p>
		</aside>

        <p>The FK8’s paint pulls your attention instantly — deep, clean, and flawless. It’s the kind of finish that looks expensive because it is. Then the Focus hits you with pure attitude, no apologies, no compromises — just raw aggression on wheels.</p>

        <p>What makes this picture fire is the respect they command together. One car shows class; the other shows claws. One whispers “quality,” the other yells “come find out.” And together they hit that perfect balance between elegance and outright madness.</p>

        <p>Both owners clearly built their cars with intention, vision, and zero shortcuts. You can feel it in the details — the aero lines, the fitment, the paint, the stance, the presence. This isn’t a random meetup photo. This is two heavy-hitting builds standing shoulder to shoulder, each flexing in their own way.</p>

        <p>This is the type of duo lineups that shuts down a parking lot. Clean on one side, aggressive on the other — and both absolutely dialed.</p>
